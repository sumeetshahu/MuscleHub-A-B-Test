# MuscleHub A/B/Test
MuscleHub is a fancy gym.Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:
<ul>
    <li>Take a fitness test with a personal trainer</li>
    <li>Fill out an application for the gym</li>
    <li>Send in their payment for their first monthâ€™s membership</li>
</ul>
Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:
<ul>
    <li>Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer</li>
    <li>Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application</li>
</ul>

The objective is to help MuscleHub analyze the A/B test and choose a business strategy.
